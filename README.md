# Static Comp Challenge 3

Our task was to recreate a given comp using only HTML and CSS. We were not provided with any assets, nor native files. We had creative license to change the copy, images, icons, and color palette. 

The following were our requirements: 

* Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css
* Site must be responsive

## Original Comp

## My Comp

For the CSS, I used a mix of grid and flexbox to make the site responsive at various breakpoints.
